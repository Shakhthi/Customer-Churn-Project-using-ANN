# Customer Churn Prediction using ANN 📊

This repository demonstrates an end‑to‑end **Customer Churn Prediction pipeline** built with **Artificial Neural Networks (ANNs)** and deployed through a modern **Streamlit application**. It combines robust machine learning practices with an intuitive interface, making predictive analytics accessible to both technical and non‑technical audiences.

---

## 🚀 Key Features
- **Data Preprocessing**: Clean and transform raw customer datasets into model‑ready inputs.  
- **Model Development**: ANN architecture implemented with TensorFlow/Keras, optimized using callbacks like early stopping.  
- **Training & Evaluation**: Visualize accuracy and loss curves to monitor learning progress and generalization.  
- **Interactive Deployment**: Streamlit app (`app.py`) enables CSV upload, exploratory data analysis (EDA), and churn predictions.  
- **Visualization**: Clear plots of training history to assess overfitting and model performance.  
- **Reproducibility**: Curated `requirements.txt` ensures smooth installation and deployment.
